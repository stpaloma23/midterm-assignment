                <p>The district was one of five districts in New York State where more
                  students were enrolled in private school than in public school due to religious reasons.
                  Of the 18,000 children transported by the district, 10,500 were students of yeshiva private schools.

                <p>due to lowered taxes and reduced budgets, the district's finances had decreased and services were reduced
                  at the schools, forcing students to take five- and six-year graduation plans instead of four-year plans.
                  Schools were heavily understaffed.

                   was presented to the electorate and on which cutbacks and layoffs were based.

                  delivered a sharply critical assessment. The monitor, Hank Greenberg, said the board
                  showed favoritism to Jewish students who attend private Orthodox schools in the district,
                  and cut services to the 9,000 district students, mostly black and Hispanic, who attend the district's public schools. </p>
