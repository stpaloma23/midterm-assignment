                  <p>The district was one of five districts in New York State where more
                    students were enrolled in private school than in public school due to religious reasons.
                    Of the 18,000 children transported by the district, 10,500 were students of private schools.

                    at the schools, forcing students to take five- and six-year graduation plans instead of four-year plans.
                    Schools were heavily understaffed.
