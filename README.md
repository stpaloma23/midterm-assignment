# midterm-assignment
this is my midterm presentation for Intro To Web Development. 
I did a website mimicking the style of the New York Times and other modern news websites. This is an informative website about the school district I attended before attending college and the struggles the Majority black and hsipanic students face in this district that is ruled by members who attend private schools. 
i used Countless of articles written by the new york times, Lohud, news 12, and instagram to get my sources, 
essentially this is a research paper, but i used different design choices to lay out the information in a digetable and user friendly and engageing way. 
In the initial designs of the website, the website was very black and white and bland, after getting feedback I decided to add a few photos to the timeline to allow for users to be more engaged visually when reading the timeline. I debated about the picture placement and then settled on placing the text next to the photo on the same side of the timeline. 
I also made adjustments to the effects section of the website, removing the harsh borders and thick arrow and replacing it with a thinner arrow and no borders to maintain the same feel throughout the website. 
My goal was to have this website be as informative as possible displaying the facts of the situation, and making people aware of an issue gong on in a school district that is less than an hour and a half away from NYC.
