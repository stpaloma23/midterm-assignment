        <h1 id="naacp" >NAACP Lawsuit </h1>
        <p>
          In 2020 the Spring Valley NAACP won a historic civil rights lawsuit against The
           East Ramapo Central School District. The lawsuit claimed that the at-large voting
            system that the board was used to elect board members was in violation of the 1965
             Voting Rights Act. They claimed that this voting system disenfranchised the public
              school students of the community who were majority-minority students. Compared to
              the board members who sent their children to private Yeshiva schools and therefore prioritized the needs of those schools instead over the public school.

        <p>This is how the NYCLU New York Civil Liberties Union described the district.
          After the district attempted to appeal to the upper courts claiming the findings were incorrect,
          the NYS Supreme Court ruled in favor of the NAACP.
          The result of this lawsuit was the implementation of the ward system. Where every town in
           the district will be able to elect a member to the board. Because of this, Three black women were
           able to earn spots on the board, which allows for there to be advocates for the public school children.

        <h1 id="postnaacp" >The Fallout Of the Lawsuit</h1>
        <p>Because of the expenses the lawsuit caused on the district, the interim superintendent claimed that there was a <b>4.3 million dollar deficit </b> in the district’s legal expenses.
          In an attempt to balance out the money lost from the lawsuit and the appeals, the superintendent threatened to fire <b> 32 teachers</b>,
          in the middle of the pandemic, along with threatening to increase class sizes.</p>

        <h1 id="pandemic" >The Impact of the Pandemic</h1>
          <p>In March 2020, East Ramapo was one of the first districts in the county to
          shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic. This district was hit especially
          hard due to the socioeconomic status of a large majority of students in the district. </p>
          <h2>47% of students last year (2019-2020 school year) were marked as chronically absent </h2>
          <p>due to the district failing to provide students with adequate materials to participate in remote learning. It took nine months for the district
             to provide every student with a Chromebook to participate in remote learning.
             The district claimed they ordered the Chromebook earlier, but it was taking a while to
             fulfill the order. In reality, the order was never placed. It took October 2020, after public
              scrutiny for the district to provide every student with the proper technology. </p>
          <h2>70% of the 22.25 million dollars of state funding provided by the CARES act went to the private schools in the district. </h2>
          <p>ERCSD historically rejects the most public school budgets of any district in NYS. Because of this,
             every year the district operates at a financial disadvantage. The pandemic along with the
              lawsuits and mismanagement of funds has caused a budget shortfall of 30 million dollars, which may lead to
               drastic budget cuts. The district is currently being audited. </p>
          <p>During the 2019-2020 school year, a year before Dr.Wortham left, all of the districts schools besides the highschool
          were able to go from the in danger zone to "good standing" in the eyes of NY State. It is unfortunate that the pandemic has
        taken the distict back years over the span of a few months. </p>

          <li>Latino students who makeup 60% of the district have a 53% graduation rate and a dropout rate of 30%</li>
          <li>There is a dire need for proper ESL Education to accommodate the growing population of ESL students,
            however, with the budget cuts, it is difficult to find bilingual teachers and resources to ensure these
            students are catered for.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The students of this district have been fighting for their right to a fair
          education from the moment they step foot into the district. It Is time that
          the needs of these students are prioritized. </p>
